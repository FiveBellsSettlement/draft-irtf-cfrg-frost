--- abstract

This document specifies the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) signing protocol.
FROST signatures can be issued after a threshold number of entities cooperate to
compute a signature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and
redundancy with respect to a secret key. FROST depends only on a prime-order group and cryptographic
hash function. This document specifies a number of ciphersuites to instantiate FROST using different
prime-order groups and hash functions. One such ciphersuite can be used to produce signatures
that can be verified with an Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA, as defined in RFC8032)
compliant verifier. However, unlike EdDSA, the signatures produced by FROST are not deterministic.
This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.

# Introduction

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for this draft is
maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be submitted as pull requests
at https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost. Instructions are on that page as
well.

Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures
require cooperation among a threshold number of signing participants each holding a share
of a common private key. The security of threshold schemes in general assumes
that an adversary can corrupt strictly fewer than a threshold number of signer participants.

This document specifies the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) signing protocol
based on the original work in {{FROST20}}. FROST reduces network overhead during
threshold signing operations while employing a novel technique to protect against forgery
attacks applicable to prior Schnorr-based threshold signature constructions. FROST requires
two rounds to compute a signature. Single-round signing variants based on {{FROST20}} are out of scope.

FROST depends only on a prime-order group and cryptographic hash function. This document specifies
a number of ciphersuites to instantiate FROST using different prime-order groups and hash functions.
Two ciphersuites can be used to produce signatures that are compatible with Edwards-Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) variants Ed25519 and Ed448 as specified in {{!RFC8032}}, i.e., the
signatures can be verified with an {{!RFC8032}} compliant verifier. However, unlike EdDSA, the
signatures produced by FROST are not deterministic, since deriving nonces deterministically allows
for a complete key-recovery attack in multi-party discrete logarithm-based signatures.

Key generation for FROST signing is out of scope for this document. However, for completeness,
key generation with a trusted dealer is specified in {{dep-dealer}}.

This document represents the consensus of the Crypto Forum Research
Group (CFRG). It is not an IETF product and is not a standard.

# Cryptographic Dependencies

FROST signing depends on the following cryptographic constructs:

- Prime-order Group, {{dep-pog}};
- Cryptographic hash function, {{dep-hash}};

These are described in the following sections.

## Prime-Order Group {#dep-pog}

FROST depends on an abelian group of prime order `p`. We represent this
group as the object `G` that additionally defines helper functions described below. The group operation
for `G` is addition `+` with identity element `I`. For any elements `A` and `B` of the group `G`,
`A + B = B + A` is also a member of `G`. Also, for any `A` in `G`, there exists an element
`-A` such that `A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I`. For convenience, we use `-` to denote
subtraction, e.g., `A - B = A + (-B)`. Integers, taken modulo the group order `p`, are called
scalars; arithmetic operations on scalars are implicitly performed modulo `p`. Since `p` is prime,
scalars form a finite field. Scalar multiplication is equivalent to the repeated
application of the group operation on an element `A` with itself `r-1` times, denoted as
`ScalarMult(A, r)`. We denote the sum, difference, and product of two scalars using the `+`, `-`,
and `*` operators, respectively. (Note that this means `+` may refer to group element addition or
scalar addition, depending on the type of the operands.) For any element `A`, `ScalarMult(A, p) = I`.
We denote `B` as a fixed generator of the group. Scalar base multiplication is equivalent to the repeated application
of the group operation on `B` with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted as `ScalarBaseMult(r)`. The set of
scalars corresponds to `GF(p)`, which we refer to as the scalar field. It is assumed that
group element addition, negation, and equality comparison can be efficiently computed for
arbitrary group elements.

This document uses types `Element` and `Scalar` to denote elements of the group `G` and
its set of scalars, respectively. We denote Scalar(x) as the conversion of integer input `x`
to the corresponding Scalar value with the same numeric value. For example, Scalar(1) yields
a Scalar representing the value 1. Moreover, we use the type `NonZeroScalar` to denote a `Scalar`
value that is not equal to zero, i.e., Scalar(0). We denote equality comparison of these types
as `==` and assignment of values by `=`. When comparing Scalar values, e.g., for the purposes
of sorting lists of Scalar values, the least nonnegative representation mod `p` is used.

We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on `G`.

- Order(): Outputs the order of `G` (i.e., `p`).
- Identity(): Outputs the identity `Element` of the group (i.e., `I`).
- RandomScalar(): Outputs a random `Scalar` element in GF(p), i.e., a random scalar in \[0, p - 1\].
- ScalarMult(A, k): Outputs the scalar multiplication between Element `A` and Scalar `k`.
- ScalarBaseMult(k): Outputs the scalar multiplication between Scalar `k` and the group generator `B`.
- SerializeElement(A): Maps an `Element` `A` to a canonical byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ne`. This
  function raises an error if `A` is the identity element of the group.
- DeserializeElement(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to an `Element` `A`,
  and fails if the input is not the valid canonical byte representation of an element of
  the group. This function raises an error if deserialization fails
  or if `A` is the identity element of the group; see {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific
  input validation steps.
- SerializeScalar(s): Maps a Scalar `s` to a canonical byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ns`.
- DeserializeScalar(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to a `Scalar` `s`.
  This function raises an error if deserialization fails; see
  {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific input validation steps.

## Cryptographic Hash Function {#dep-hash}

FROST requires the use of a cryptographically secure hash function, generically
written as H, which is modeled as a random oracle in security proofs for the protocol
(see {{FROST20}} and {{StrongerSec22}}). For concrete recommendations on hash functions
which SHOULD be used in practice, see {{ciphersuites}}. Using H, we introduce distinct
domain-separated hashes, H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5:

- H1, H2, and H3 map arbitrary byte strings to Scalar elements associated with the prime-order group.
- H4 and H5 are aliases for H with distinct domain separators.

The details of H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 vary based on ciphersuite. See {{ciphersuites}}
for more details about each.

# Helper Functions {#helpers}

Beyond the core dependencies, the protocol in this document depends on the
following helper operations:

- Nonce generation, {{dep-nonces}};
- Polynomials, {{dep-polynomial}};
- Encoding operations, {{dep-encoding}};
- Signature binding computation {{dep-binding-factor}};
- Group commitment computation {{dep-group-commit}}; and
- Signature challenge computation {{dep-sig-challenge}}.

The following sections describe these operations in more detail.

## Nonce generation {#dep-nonces}

To hedge against a bad RNG that outputs predictable values, nonces are
generated with the `nonce_generate` function by combining fresh randomness
with the secret key as input to a domain-separated hash function built
from the ciphersuite hash function `H`. This domain-separated hash function
is denoted `H3`. This function always samples 32 bytes of fresh randomness
to ensure that the probability of nonce reuse is at most 2<sup>-128</sup>
as long as no more than 2<sup>64</sup> signatures are computed by a given
signing participant.

~~~
Inputs:
- secret, a Scalar.

Outputs:
- nonce, a Scalar.

def nonce_generate(secret):
  random_bytes = random_bytes(32)
  secret_enc = G.SerializeScalar(secret)
  return H3(random_bytes || secret_enc)
~~~

## Polynomials {#dep-polynomial}

This section defines polynomials over Scalars that are used in the main protocol.
A polynomial of maximum degree t is represented as a list of t+1 coefficients,
where the constant term of the polynomial is in the first position and the
highest-degree coefficient is in the last position. For example, the polynomial
`x^2 + 2x + 3` has degree 2 and is represented as a list of 3 coefficients `[3, 2, 1]`.
A point on the polynomial `f` is a tuple (x, y), where `y = f(x)`.

The function `derive_interpolating_value` derives a value used for polynomial
interpolation. It is provided a list of x-coordinates as input, each of which
cannot equal 0.

~~~
Inputs:
- L, the list of x-coordinates, each a NonZeroScalar.
- x_i, an x-coordinate contained in L, a NonZeroScalar.

Outputs:
- value, a Scalar.

Errors:
- "invalid parameters", if 1) x_i is not in L, or if 2) any
  x-coordinate is represented more than once in L.

def derive_interpolating_value(L, x_i):
  if x_i not in L:
    raise "invalid parameters"
  for x_j in L:
    if count(x_j, L) > 1:
      raise "invalid parameters"

  numerator = Scalar(1)
  denominator = Scalar(1)
  for x_j in L:
    if x_j == x_i: continue
    numerator *= x_j
    denominator *= x_j - x_i

  value = numerator / denominator
  return value
~~~

## List Operations {#dep-encoding}

This section describes helper functions that work on lists of values produced
during the FROST protocol. The following function encodes a list of participant
commitments into a byte string for use in the FROST protocol.

~~~
Inputs:
- commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
  binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
  each participant, where each element in the list indicates a
  NonZeroScalar identifier i and two commitment Element values
  (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
  MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.

Outputs:
- encoded_group_commitment, the serialized representation of
  commitment_list, a byte string.

def encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list):
  encoded_group_commitment = nil
  for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment,
       binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
    encoded_commitment = (
        G.SerializeScalar(identifier) ||
        G.SerializeElement(hiding_nonce_commitment) ||
        G.SerializeElement(binding_nonce_commitment))
    encoded_group_commitment = (
        encoded_group_commitment ||
        encoded_commitment)
  return encoded_group_commitment
~~~

The following function is used to extract identifiers from a commitment list.

~~~
Inputs:
- commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
  binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
  each participant, where each element in the list indicates a

  (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
  MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.

Outputs:
- identifiers, a list of NonZeroScalar values.

def participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list):
  identifiers = []
  for (identifier, _, _) in commitment_list:
    identifiers.append(identifier)
  return identifiers
~~~

The following function is used to extract a binding factor from a list of binding factors.

~~~
Inputs:
- binding_factor_list = [(i, binding_factor), ...],
  a list of binding factors for each participant, where each element
  in the list indicates a NonZeroScalar identifier i and Scalar
  binding factor.
- identifier, participant identifier, a NonZeroScalar.

Outputs:
- binding_factor, a Scalar.

Errors:
- "invalid participant", when the designated participant is
  not known.

def binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factor_list, identifier):
  for (i, binding_factor) in binding_factor_list:
    if identifier == i:
      return binding_factor
  raise "invalid participant"
~~~

  MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.
- msg, the message to be signed.

Outputs:
- binding_factor_list, a list of (NonZeroScalar, Scalar) tuples
  representing the binding factors.

def compute_binding_factors(group_public_key, commitment_list, msg):
  group_public_key_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_public_key)
  // Hashed to a fixed-length.
  msg_hash = H4(msg)
  // Hashed to a fixed-length.
  encoded_commitment_hash =
      H5(encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list))
  // The encoding of the group public key is a fixed length within a ciphersuite.
  rho_input_prefix = group_public_key_enc || msg_hash || encoded_commitment_hash

  binding_factor_list = []
  for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment,
       binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
    rho_input = rho_input_prefix || G.SerializeScalar(identifier)

    binding_factor_list.append((identifier, binding_factor))
  return binding_factor_list

  MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.
- binding_factor_list = [(i, binding_factor), ...],
  a list of (NonZeroScalar, Scalar) tuples representing the binding
  factor Scalar for the given identifier.

Outputs:

    binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(
        binding_factor_list, identifier)

        binding_nonce_commitment,
        binding_factor)
    group_commitment = (
        group_commitment +

~~~

# Two-Round FROST Signing Protocol {#frost-spec}

This section describes the two-round FROST signing protocol for producing Schnorr signatures.
The protocol is configured to run with a selection of `NUM_PARTICIPANTS` signer participants and a Coordinator.
`NUM_PARTICIPANTS` is a positive integer at least `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` but no larger than
`MAX_PARTICIPANTS`, where `MIN_PARTICIPANTS <= MAX_PARTICIPANTS`, `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` is a positive
non-zero integer and `MAX_PARTICIPANTS` is a positive integer less than the group order.
A signer participant, or simply participant, is an entity that is trusted to hold and
use a signing key share. The Coordinator is an entity with the following responsibilities:

1. Determining which participants will participate (at least MIN_PARTICIPANTS in number);
2. Coordinating rounds (receiving and forwarding inputs among participants); and
3. Aggregating signature shares output by each participant, and publishing the resulting signature.

FROST assumes that the Coordinator and the set of signer participants are chosen
externally to the protocol. Note that it is possible to deploy the protocol without
a distinguished Coordinator; see {{no-coordinator}} for more information.

FROST produces signatures that can be verified as if they were produced from a single signer
using a signing key `s` with corresponding public key `PK`, where `s` is a Scalar
value and `PK = G.ScalarBaseMult(s)`. As a threshold signing protocol, the group signing
key `s` is Shamir secret-shared amongst each of the `MAX_PARTICIPANTS` participants
and used to produce signatures; see {{dep-shamir}} for more information about Shamir secret sharing.
In particular, FROST assumes each participant is configured with the following information:

- An identifier, which is a NonZeroScalar value denoted `i` in the range `[1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS]`
  and MUST be distinct from the identifier of every other participant.
- A signing key `sk_i`, which is a Scalar value representing the i-th Shamir secret share
  of the group signing key `s`. In particular, `sk_i` is the value `f(i)` on a secret
  polynomial `f` of degree `(MIN_PARTICIPANTS - 1)`, where `s` is `f(0)`. The public key
  corresponding to this signing key share is `PK_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk_i)`.

The Coordinator and each participant are additionally configured with common group
information, denoted "group info," which consists of the following:

- Group public key, which is an `Element` in `G` denoted `PK`.
- Public keys `PK_i` for each participant, which are `Element` values in `G` denoted `PK_i`
  for each `i` in `[1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS]`.

This document does not specify how this information, including the signing key shares,
are configured and distributed to participants. In general, two possible configuration
mechanisms are possible: one that requires a single, trusted dealer, and the other
which requires performing a distributed key generation protocol. We highlight
key generation mechanism by a trusted dealer in {{dep-dealer}} for reference.

FROST requires two rounds to complete. In the first round, participants generate
and publish one-time-use commitments to be used in the second round. In the second
round, each participant produces a share of the signature over the Coordinator-chosen
message and the other participant commitments. After the second round completes, the
Coordinator aggregates the signature shares to produce a final signature. The Coordinator
SHOULD abort if the signature is invalid; see {{abort}} for more information about dealing
with invalid signatures and misbehaving participants. This complete interaction,
without abort, is shown in {{fig-frost}}.

{: #fig-frost title="FROST protocol overview" }

Details for round one are described in {{frost-round-one}}, and details for round two
are described in {{frost-round-two}}. Note that each participant persists some state between
the two rounds, and this state is deleted as described in {{frost-round-two}}. The final
Aggregation step is described in {{frost-aggregation}}.

FROST assumes that all inputs to each round, especially those of which are received
over the network, are validated before use. In particular, this means that any value
of type Element or Scalar is deserialized using DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar,
respectively, as these functions perform the necessary input validation steps, and that all
messages sent over the wire are encoded appropriately, e.g., that Scalars and Elements are
encoded using their respective functions.

FROST assumes reliable message delivery between the Coordinator and participants in
order for the protocol to complete. An attacker masquerading as another participant
will result only in an invalid signature; see {{sec-considerations}}. However, in order
to identify misbehaving participants,
we assume that the network channel is additionally authenticated; confidentiality is
not required.

## Round One - Commitment {#frost-round-one}

Round one involves each participant generating nonces and their corresponding public commitments.
A nonce is a pair of Scalar values, and a commitment is a pair of Element values. Each participant's
behavior in this round is described by the `commit` function below. Note that this function
invokes `nonce_generate` twice, once for each type of nonce produced. The output of this function is
a pair of secret nonces `(hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)` and their corresponding public commitments
`(hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)`.

~~~
Inputs:
- sk_i, the secret key share, a Scalar.

Outputs:
- (nonce, comm), a tuple of nonce and nonce commitment pairs,
  where each value in the nonce pair is a Scalar and each value in
  the nonce commitment pair is an Element.

def commit(sk_i):
  hiding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
  binding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
  hiding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(hiding_nonce)
  binding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(binding_nonce)
  nonces = (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)
  comms = (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
  return (nonces, comms)
~~~

The outputs `nonce` and `comm` from participant `P_i` should both be stored locally and
kept for use in the second round. The `nonce` value is secret and MUST NOT be shared, whereas
the public output `comm` is sent to the Coordinator. The nonce values produced by this
function MUST NOT be used in more than one invocation of `sign`, and the nonces MUST be generated
from a source of secure randomness.

## Round Two - Signature Share Generation {#frost-round-two}

In round two, the Coordinator is responsible for sending the message to be signed, and
for choosing which participants will participate (of number at least MIN_PARTICIPANTS). Signers
additionally require locally held data; specifically, their private key and the
nonces corresponding to their commitment issued in round one.

The Coordinator begins by sending each participant the message to be signed along with the
set of signing commitments for all participants in the participant list. Each participant
MUST validate the inputs before processing the Coordinator's request. In particular,
the Signer MUST validate commitment_list, deserializing each group Element in the
list using DeserializeElement from {{dep-pog}}. If deserialization fails, the Signer
MUST abort the protocol. Moreover, each participant MUST ensure that
its identifier and commitments (from the first round) appear in commitment_list.
Applications which require that participants not process arbitrary
input messages are also required to perform relevant application-layer input
validation checks; see {{message-validation}} for more details.

Upon receipt and successful input validation, each Signer then runs the following
procedure to produce its own signature share.

~~~
Inputs:
- identifier, identifier i of the participant, a NonZeroScalar.
- sk_i, Signer secret key share, a Scalar.
- group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing
  key, an Element.
- nonce_i, pair of Scalar values (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)
  generated in round one.
- msg, the message to be signed, a byte string.
- commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
  binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
  each participant, where each element in the list indicates a
  NonZeroScalar identifier i and two commitment Element values
  (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
  MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.


Outputs:
- sig_share, a signature share, a Scalar.

def sign(identifier, sk_i, group_public_key,
         nonce_i, msg, commitment_list):
  # Compute the binding factor(s)
  binding_factor_list = compute_binding_factors(group_public_key, commitment_list, msg)
  binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(
      binding_factor_list, identifier)

  # Compute the group commitment
  group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(
      commitment_list, binding_factor_list)

  # Compute the interpolating value
  participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(
      commitment_list)
  lambda_i = derive_interpolating_value(participant_list, identifier)

  # Compute the per-message challenge
  challenge = compute_challenge(
      group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

  # Compute the signature share
  (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) = nonce_i
  sig_share = hiding_nonce + (binding_nonce * binding_factor) +
      (lambda_i * sk_i * challenge)

  return sig_share
~~~

The output of this procedure is a signature share. Each participant then sends
these shares back to the Coordinator. Each participant MUST delete the nonce and
corresponding commitment after completing `sign`, and MUST NOT use the nonce
as input more than once to `sign`.

Note that the `lambda_i` value derived during this procedure does not change
across FROST signing operations for the same signing group. As such, participants
can compute it once and store it for reuse across signing sessions.

## Signature Share Aggregation {#frost-aggregation}

After participants perform round two and send their signature shares to the Coordinator,
the Coordinator aggregates each share to produce a final signature. Before aggregating,
the Coordinator MUST validate each signature share using DeserializeScalar. If validation
fails, the Coordinator MUST abort the protocol as the resulting signature will be invalid.
If all signature shares are valid, the Coordinator aggregates them to produce the final
signature using the following procedure.

~~~
Inputs:
- commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
  binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
  each participant, where each element in the list indicates a
  NonZeroScalar identifier i and two commitment Element values
  (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
  MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.
- msg, the message to be signed, a byte string.
- group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing
  key, an Element.
- sig_shares, a set of signature shares z_i, Scalar values, for each
  participant, of length NUM_PARTICIPANTS, where
  MIN_PARTICIPANTS <= NUM_PARTICIPANTS <= MAX_PARTICIPANTS.

Outputs:
- (R, z), a Schnorr signature consisting of an Element R and
  Scalar z.

def aggregate(commitment_list, msg, group_public_key, sig_shares):
  # Compute the binding factors
  binding_factor_list = compute_binding_factors(group_public_key, commitment_list, msg)

  # Compute the group commitment
  group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(
      commitment_list, binding_factor_list)

  # Compute aggregated signature
  z = Scalar(0)
  for z_i in sig_shares:
    z = z + z_i
  return (group_commitment, z)
~~~

The output from the aggregation step is the output signature (R, z). The canonical encoding
of this signature is specified in {{ciphersuites}}.

The Coordinator SHOULD verify this signature using the group public key before publishing or
releasing the signature. Signature verification is as specified for the corresponding
ciphersuite; see {{ciphersuites}} for details. The aggregate signature will verify successfully
if all signature shares are valid. Moreover, subsets of valid signature shares will themselves not yield
a valid aggregate signature.

If the aggregate signature verification fails, the Coordinator can verify each signature
share individually to identify and act on misbehaving participants. The mechanism for acting on
a misbehaving participant is out of scope for this specification; see {{abort}} for more information
about dealing with invalid signatures and misbehaving participants.

The function for verifying a signature share, denoted `verify_signature_share`, is described below.
Recall that the Coordinator is configured with "group info" which contains
the group public key `PK` and public keys `PK_i` for each participant, so the `group_public_key` and
`PK_i` function arguments should come from that previously stored group info.

~~~
Inputs:
- identifier, identifier i of the participant, a NonZeroScalar.
- PK_i, the public key for the i-th participant, where
  PK_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk_i), an Element.
- comm_i, pair of Element values in G
  (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) generated in
  round one from the i-th participant.
- sig_share_i, a Scalar value indicating the signature share as
  produced in round two from the i-th participant.
- commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i,
  binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by
  each participant, where each element in the list indicates a
  NonZeroScalar identifier i and two commitment Element values
  (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list
  MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.
- group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing
  key, an Element.
- msg, the message to be signed, a byte string.

Outputs:
- True if the signature share is valid, and False otherwise.

def verify_signature_share(
        identifier, PK_i, comm_i, sig_share_i, commitment_list,
        group_public_key, msg):
  # Compute the binding factors
  binding_factor_list = compute_binding_factors(group_public_key, commitment_list, msg)
  binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(
      binding_factor_list, identifier)

  # Compute the group commitment
  group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(
      commitment_list, binding_factor_list)

  # Compute the commitment share
  (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) = comm_i
  comm_share = hiding_nonce_commitment + G.ScalarMult(
      binding_nonce_commitment, binding_factor)

  # Compute the challenge
  challenge = compute_challenge(
      group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

  # Compute the interpolating value
  participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(
      commitment_list)
  lambda_i = derive_interpolating_value(x_list, identifier)

  # Compute relation values
  l = G.ScalarBaseMult(sig_share_i)
  r = comm_share + G.ScalarMult(PK_i, challenge * lambda_i)

  return l == r
~~~

The Coordinator can verify each signature share before first aggregating and verifying the
signature under the group public key. However, since the aggregate signature is valid if
all signature shares are valid, this order of operations is more expensive if the
signature is valid.

## Identifiable Abort {#abort}

FROST does not provide robustness; i.e, all participants are required to complete the
protocol honestly in order to generate a valid signature. When the signing protocol
does not produce a valid signature, the Coordinator SHOULD abort; see {{sec-considerations}}
for more information about FROST's security properties and the threat model.

As a result of this property, a misbehaving participant can cause a denial-of-service on
the signing protocol by contributing malformed signature shares or refusing to participate.
Identifying misbehaving participants that produce invalid shares can be done by checking
signature shares from each participant using `verify_signature_share` as described in {{frost-aggregation}}.
FROST assumes the network channel is authenticated to identify which signer misbehaved.
FROST allows for identifying misbehaving participants that produce invalid signature shares
as described in {{frost-aggregation}}. FROST does not provide accommodations for identifying
participants that refuse to participate, though applications are assumed to detect when participants
fail to engage in the signing protocol.

In both cases, preventing this type of attack requires the Coordinator to identify
misbehaving participants such that applications can take corrective action. The mechanism
for acting on misbehaving participants is out of scope for this specification. However,
one reasonable approach would be to remove the misbehaving participant from the set of allowed
participants in future runs of FROST.

# Ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

A FROST ciphersuite must specify the underlying prime-order group details
and cryptographic hash function. Each ciphersuite is denoted as (Group, Hash),
e.g., (ristretto255, SHA-512). This section contains some ciphersuites.
Each ciphersuite also includes a context string, denoted `contextString`,
which is an ASCII string literal (with no NULL terminating character).

The RECOMMENDED ciphersuite is (ristretto255, SHA-512) as described in {{recommended-suite}}.
The (Ed25519, SHA-512) and (Ed448, SHAKE256) ciphersuites are included
for compatibility with Ed25519 and Ed448 as defined in {{!RFC8032}}.

The DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar functions instantiated for a
particular prime-order group corresponding to a ciphersuite MUST adhere
to the description in {{dep-pog}}. Validation steps for these functions
are described for each of the ciphersuites below. Future ciphersuites MUST
describe how input validation is done for DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar.

Each ciphersuite includes explicit instructions for verifying signatures produced
by FROST. Note that these instructions are equivalent to those produced by a single
participant.

Each ciphersuite adheres to the requirements in {{ciphersuite-reqs}}. Future
ciphersuites MUST also adhere to these requirements.

## FROST(Ed25519, SHA-512)

This ciphersuite uses edwards25519 for the Group and SHA-512 for the Hash function `H`
meant to produce Ed25519-compliant signatures as specified in {{Section 5.1 of !RFC8032}}.
The value of the contextString parameter is "FROST-ED25519-SHA512-v11".

- Group: edwards25519 {{!RFC8032}}, where Ne = 32 and Ns = 32.
  - Order(): Return 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493 (see {{?RFC7748}}).
  - Identity(): As defined in {{RFC7748}}.
  - RandomScalar(): Implemented by returning a uniformly random Scalar in the range
    \[0, `G.Order()` - 1\]. Refer to {{random-scalar}} for implementation guidance.
  - SerializeElement(A): Implemented as specified in {{!RFC8032, Section 5.1.2}}.
    Additionally, this function validates that the input element is not the group
    identity element.
  - DeserializeElement(buf): Implemented as specified in {{!RFC8032, Section 5.1.3}}.
    Additionally, this function validates that the resulting element is not the group
    identity element and is in the prime-order subgroup. If any of these checks fail,
    deserialization returns an error. The latter check can
    be implemented by multiplying the resulting point by the order of the group and
    checking that the result is the identity element. Note that optimizations for
    this check exist; see {{Pornin22}}.
  - SerializeScalar(s): Implemented by outputting the little-endian 32-byte encoding of
    the Scalar value with the top three bits set to zero.
  - DeserializeScalar(buf): Implemented by attempting to deserialize a Scalar from a
    little-endian 32-byte string. This function can fail if the input does not
    represent a Scalar in the range \[0, `G.Order()` - 1\]. Note that this means the
    top three bits of the input MUST be zero.

- Hash (`H`): SHA-512, which has 64 bytes of output
  - H1(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "rho" \|\| m), interpreting the 64-byte digest
    as a little-endian integer, and reducing the resulting integer modulo
    2^252+27742317777372353535851937790883648493.
  - H2(m): Implemented by computing H(m), interpreting the 64-byte digest
    as a little-endian integer, and reducing the resulting integer modulo
    2^252+27742317777372353535851937790883648493.
  - H3(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "nonce" \|\| m), interpreting the 64-byte digest
    as a little-endian integer, and reducing the resulting integer modulo
    2^252+27742317777372353535851937790883648493.
  - H4(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "msg" \|\| m).
  - H5(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "com" \|\| m).


Normally H2 would also include a domain separator, but for compatibility with {{!RFC8032}}, it is omitted.

Signature verification is as specified in {{Section 5.1.7 of RFC8032}} with the
constraint that implementations MUST check the group equation `[8][z]B = [8]R + [8][c]PK`
(changed to use the notation in this document).

Canonical signature encoding is as specified in {{sig-encoding}}.

## FROST(ristretto255, SHA-512) {#recommended-suite}

  - Identity(): As defined in {{RISTRETTO}}.
  - RandomScalar(): Implemented by returning a uniformly random Scalar in the range
    \[0, `G.Order()` - 1\]. Refer to {{random-scalar}} for implementation guidance.
  - SerializeElement(A): Implemented using the 'Encode' function from {{!RISTRETTO}}.
    Additionally, this function validates that the input element is not the group
    identity element.
  - DeserializeElement(buf): Implemented using the 'Decode' function from {{!RISTRETTO}}.
    Additionally, this function validates that the resulting element is not the group
    identity element. If either 'Decode' or that check fails, deserialization returns an error.
  - SerializeScalar(s): Implemented by outputting the little-endian 32-byte encoding of
    the Scalar value with the top three bits set to zero.
  - DeserializeScalar(buf): Implemented by attempting to deserialize a Scalar from a
    little-endian 32-byte string. This function can fail if the input does not
    represent a Scalar in the range \[0, `G.Order()` - 1\]. Note that this means the
    top three bits of the input MUST be zero.

- Hash (`H`): SHA-512, which has 64 bytes of output

  - H5(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "com" \|\| m).

Signature verification is as specified in {{prime-order-verify}}.

Canonical signature encoding is as specified in {{sig-encoding}}.

## FROST(Ed448, SHAKE256)

This ciphersuite uses edwards448 for the Group and SHAKE256 for the Hash function `H`
meant to produce Ed448-compliant signatures as specified in {{Section 5.2 of RFC8032}}. Note that this
ciphersuite does not allow applications to specify a context string as is allowed for Ed448
in {{RFC8032}}, and always sets the {{RFC8032}} context string to the empty string.
The value of the (internal to FROST) contextString parameter is "FROST-ED448-SHAKE256-v11".

- Group: edwards448 {{!RFC8032}}, where Ne = 57 and Ns = 57.

    Additionally, this function validates that the input element is not the group
    identity element.

    Additionally, this function validates that the resulting element is not the group
    identity element and is in the prime-order subgroup. If any of these checks fail,
    deserialization returns an error. The latter check can
    be implemented by multiplying the resulting point by the order of the group and
    checking that the result is the identity element. Note that optimizations for
    this check exist; see {{Pornin22}}.
  - SerializeScalar(s): Implemented by outputting the little-endian 57-byte encoding of
    the Scalar value.
  - DeserializeScalar(buf): Implemented by attempting to deserialize a Scalar from a
    little-endian 57-byte string. This function can fail if the input does not
    represent a Scalar in the range \[0, `G.Order()` - 1\].

- Hash (`H`): SHAKE256 with 114 bytes of output
  - H1(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "rho" \|\| m), interpreting the
    114-byte digest as a little-endian integer, and reducing the resulting integer modulo
    2^446 - 13818066809895115352007386748515426880336692474882178609894547503885.

  - H4(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "msg" \|\| m).
  - H5(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "com" \|\| m).

Normally H2 would also include a domain separator, but for compatibility with {{!RFC8032}}, it is omitted.

## Ciphersuite Requirements {#ciphersuite-reqs}

Future documents that introduce new ciphersuites MUST adhere to
the following requirements.

1. H1, H2, and H3 all have output distributions that are close to
  (indistinguishable from) the uniform distribution.
2. All hash functions MUST be domain separated with a per-suite context
  string. Note that the FROST(Ed25519, SHA-512) ciphersuite does not
  adhere to this requirement for H2 alone to maintain compatibility
  with {{RFC8032}}.
3. The group MUST be of prime-order, and all deserialization functions MUST
  output elements that belong to their respective sets of Elements or Scalars,
  or failure when deserialization fails.
4. The canonical signature encoding details are clearly specified.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

A security analysis of FROST exists in {{FROST20}} and {{StrongerSec22}}. At a high
level, FROST provides security against Existential Unforgeability Under Chosen Message
Attack (EUF-CMA) attacks, as defined in {{StrongerSec22}}. Satisfying this requirement
requires the ciphersuite to adhere to the requirements in {{ciphersuite-reqs}}, as well
as the following assumptions to hold.

* The signer key shares are generated and distributed securely, e.g., via a trusted dealer
that performs key generation (see {{dep-vss}}) or through a distributed key generation protocol.
* The Coordinator and at most `(MIN_PARTICIPANTS-1)` participants may be corrupted.

Note that the Coordinator is not trusted with any private information and communication
at the time of signing can be performed over a public channel, as long as it is
authenticated and reliable.

FROST provides security against denial of service attacks under the following assumptions:

* The Coordinator does not perform a denial of service attack.
* The Coordinator identifies misbehaving participants such that they can be removed from
  future invocations of FROST. The Coordinator may also abort upon detecting a misbehaving
  participant to ensure that invalid signatures are not produced.

FROST does not aim to achieve the following goals:

* Post-quantum security. FROST, like plain Schnorr signatures, requires the hardness of the Discrete Logarithm Problem.
* Robustness. Preventing denial-of-service attacks against misbehaving participants requires the Coordinator
  to identify and act on misbehaving participants; see {{abort}} for more information. While FROST
  does not provide robustness, {{ROAST}} is as a wrapper protocol around FROST that does.
* Downgrade prevention. All participants in the protocol are assumed to agree on what algorithms to use.
* Metadata protection. If protection for metadata is desired, a higher-level communication
channel can be used to facilitate key generation and signing.

The rest of this section documents issues particular to implementations or deployments.

## Side-channel mitigations

Several routines process secret values (nonces, signing keys / shares), and depending
on the implementation and deployment environment, mitigating side-channels may be
pertinent. Mitigating these side-channels requires implementing `G.ScalarMult()`, `G.ScalarBaseMult()`,
`G.SerializeScalar()`, and `G.DeserializeScalar()` in constant (value-independent) time.
The various ciphersuites lend themselves differently to specific implementation techniques
and ease of achieving side-channel resistance, though ultimately avoiding value-dependent
computation or branching is the goal.

## Optimizations

{{StrongerSec22}} presented an optimization to FROST that reduces the total number of scalar multiplications
from linear in the number of signing participants to a constant. However, as described in {{StrongerSec22}},
this optimization removes the guarantee that the set of signer participants that started round one of
the protocol is the same set of signing participants that produced the signature output by round two.
As such, the optimization is NOT RECOMENDED, and it is not covered in this document.

## Nonce Reuse Attacks

{{dep-nonces}} describes the procedure that participants use to produce nonces during
the first round of signing. The randomness produced in this procedure MUST be sampled
uniformly at random. The resulting nonces produced via `nonce_generate` are indistinguishable
from values sampled uniformly at random. This requirement is necessary to avoid
replay attacks initiated by other participants, which allow for a complete key-recovery attack.
The Coordinator MAY further hedge against nonce reuse attacks by tracking participant nonce
commitments used for a given group key, at the cost of additional state.

## Protocol Failures

We do not specify what implementations should do when the protocol fails, other than requiring that
the protocol abort. Examples of viable failure include when a verification check returns invalid or
if the underlying transport failed to deliver the required messages.

## Removing the Coordinator Role {#no-coordinator}

In some settings, it may be desirable to omit the role of the Coordinator entirely.
Doing so does not change the security implications of FROST, but instead simply
requires each participant to communicate with all other participants. We loosely
describe how to perform FROST signing among participants without this coordinator role.
We assume that every participant receives as input from an external source the
message to be signed prior to performing the protocol.

Every participant begins by performing `commit()` as is done in the setting
where a Coordinator is used. However, instead of sending the commitment
to the Coordinator, every participant instead will publish
this commitment to every other participant. Then, in the second round, participants will already have
sufficient information to perform signing. They will directly perform `sign()`.
All participants will then publish their signature shares to one another. After having
received all signature shares from all other participants, each participant will then perform
`verify_signature_share` and then `aggregate` directly.

The requirements for the underlying network channel remain the same in the setting
where all participants play the role of the Coordinator, in that all messages that
are exchanged are public and so the channel simply must be reliable. However, in
the setting that a player attempts to split the view of all other players by
sending disjoint values to a subset of players, the signing operation will output
an invalid signature. To avoid this denial of service, implementations may wish
to define a mechanism where messages are authenticated, so that cheating players
can be identified and excluded.

## Input Message Hashing {#pre-hashing}

FROST signatures do not pre-hash message inputs. This means that the entire message
must be known in advance of invoking the signing protocol. Applications can apply
pre-hashing in settings where storing the full message is prohibitively expensive.
In such cases, pre-hashing MUST use a collision-resistant hash function with a security
level commensurate with the security inherent to the ciphersuite chosen. It is
RECOMMENDED that applications which choose to apply pre-hashing use the hash function
(`H`) associated with the chosen ciphersuite in a manner similar to how `H4` is defined.
In particular, a different prefix SHOULD be used to differentiate this pre-hash from
`H4`. For example, if a fictional protocol Quux decided to pre-hash its input messages,
one possible way to do so is via `H(contextString || "Quux-pre-hash" || m)`.

## Input Message Validation {#message-validation}

Message validation varies by application. For example, some applications may
require that participants only process messages of a certain structure. In digital
currency applications, wherein multiple participants may collectively sign a transaction,
it is reasonable to require that each participant check the input message to be a
syntactically valid transaction.

As another example, some applications may require that participants only process
messages with permitted content according to some policy. In digital currency
applications, this might mean that a transaction being signed is allowed and
intended by the relevant stakeholders. Another instance of this type of message
validation is in the context of {{?TLS=RFC8446}}, wherein implementations may
use threshold signing protocols to produce signatures of transcript hashes. In
this setting, signing participants might require the raw TLS handshake messages
to validate before computing the transcript hash that is signed.

In general, input message validation is an application-specific consideration
that varies based on the use case and threat model. However, it is RECOMMENDED
that applications take additional precautions and validate inputs so that
participants do not operate as signing oracles for arbitrary messages.

# Schnorr Signature Encoding {#sig-encoding}

This section describes one possible canonical encoding of FROST signatures. Using notation
from {{Section 3 of TLS}}, the encoding of a FROST signature (R, z) is as follows:

~~~
  struct {
    opaque R_encoded[Ne];
    opaque z_encoded[Ns];
  } Signature;
~~~

Where Signature.R_encoded is `G.SerializeElement(R)` and Signature.z_encoded is
`G.SerializeScalar(z)` and `G` is determined by ciphersuite.

# Schnorr Signature Generation and Verification for Prime-Order Groups {#prime-order-verify}

This section contains descriptions of functions for generating and verifying Schnorr signatures.
It is included to complement the routines present in {{RFC8032}} for prime-order groups, including
ristretto255, P-256, and secp256k1. The functions for generating and verifying signatures are
`prime_order_sign` and `prime_order_verify`, respectively.

The function `prime_order_sign` produces a Schnorr signature over a message given a full secret signing
key as input (as opposed to a key share.)

~~~
Inputs:
- msg, message to sign, a byte string.
- sk, secret key, a Scalar.

Outputs:
- (R, z), a Schnorr signature consisting of an Element R and
  Scalar z.

def prime_order_sign(msg, sk):
  r = G.RandomScalar()
  R = G.ScalarBaseMult(r)
  PK = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk)
  comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
  pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
  challenge_input = comm_enc || pk_enc || msg
  c = H2(challenge_input)
  z = r + (c * sk) // Scalar addition and multiplication
  return (R, z)
~~~

The function `prime_order_verify` verifies Schnorr signatures with validated inputs.
Specifically, it assumes that signature R component and public key belong to the prime-order group.

~~~
Inputs:
- msg, signed message, a byte string.
- sig, a tuple (R, z) output from signature generation.
- PK, public key, an Element.

Outputs:
- True if signature is valid, and False otherwise.

def prime_order_verify(msg, sig = (R, z), PK):
  comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
  pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
  challenge_input = comm_enc || pk_enc || msg
  c = H2(challenge_input)

  l = G.ScalarBaseMult(z)
  r = R + G.ScalarMult(PK, c)
  return l == r
~~~

# Trusted Dealer Key Generation {#dep-dealer}

One possible key generation mechanism is to depend on a trusted dealer, wherein the
dealer generates a group secret `s` uniformly at random and uses Shamir and Verifiable
Secret Sharing {{?ShamirSecretSharing=DOI.10.1145/359168.359176}}, as described in {{dep-shamir}} and {{dep-vss}} to create secret
shares of s, denoted `s_i` for `i = 1, ..., MAX_PARTICIPANTS`, to be sent to all `MAX_PARTICIPANTS` participants.
This operation is specified in the `trusted_dealer_keygen` algorithm. The mathematical relation
between the secret key `s` and the `MAX_PARTICIPANTS` secret shares is formalized in the `secret_share_combine(shares)`
algorithm, defined in {{dep-shamir}}.

The dealer that performs `trusted_dealer_keygen` is trusted to 1) generate good randomness, and 2) delete secret values after distributing shares to each participant, and 3) keep secret values confidential.

~~~
Inputs:
- secret_key, a group secret, a Scalar, that MUST be derived from at
  least Ns bytes of entropy.
- MAX_PARTICIPANTS, the number of shares to generate, an integer.
- MIN_PARTICIPANTS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme,
  an integer.

Outputs:
- participant_private_keys, MAX_PARTICIPANTS shares of the secret
  key s, each a tuple consisting of the participant identifier
  (a NonZeroScalar) and the key share (a Scalar).
- group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing
  key, an Element.
- vss_commitment, a vector commitment of Elements in G, to each of
  the coefficients in the polynomial defined by secret_key_shares and
  whose first element is G.ScalarBaseMult(s).

def trusted_dealer_keygen(
        secret_key, MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
  # Generate random coefficients for the polynomial
  coefficients = []
  for i in range(0, MIN_PARTICIPANTS - 1):
    coefficients.append(G.RandomScalar())
  participant_private_keys, coefficients = secret_share_shard(
      secret_key, coefficients, MAX_PARTICIPANTS)
  vss_commitment = vss_commit(coefficients):
  return participant_private_keys, vss_commitment[0], vss_commitment
~~~

It is assumed the dealer then sends one secret key share to each of the `NUM_PARTICIPANTS` participants, along with `vss_commitment`.
After receiving their secret key share and `vss_commitment`, participants MUST abort if they do not have the same view of `vss_commitment`.
The dealer can use a secure broadcast channel to ensure each participant has a consistent view of this commitment.
Furthermore, each participant MUST perform `vss_verify(secret_key_share_i, vss_commitment)`, and abort if the check fails.
The trusted dealer MUST delete the secret_key and secret_key_shares upon completion.

Use of this method for key generation requires a mutually authenticated secure channel
between the dealer and participants to send secret key shares, wherein the channel provides confidentiality
and integrity. Mutually authenticated TLS is one possible deployment option.

## Shamir Secret Sharing {#dep-shamir}

In Shamir secret sharing, a dealer distributes a secret `Scalar` `s` to `n` participants
in such a way that any cooperating subset of at least `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` participants can recover the
secret. There are two basic steps in this scheme: (1) splitting a secret into
multiple shares, and (2) combining shares to reveal the resulting secret.

This secret sharing scheme works over any field `F`. In this specification, `F` is
the scalar field of the prime-order group `G`.

The procedure for splitting a secret into shares is as follows.
The algorithm `polynomial_evaluate` is defined in {{dep-extended-polynomial-operations}}.

~~~
Inputs:
- s, secret value to be shared, a Scalar.
- coefficients, an array of size MIN_PARTICIPANTS - 1 with randomly
  generated Scalars, not including the 0th coefficient of the
  polynomial.
- MAX_PARTICIPANTS, the number of shares to generate, an integer less
  than 2^16.

Outputs:
- secret_key_shares, A list of MAX_PARTICIPANTS number of secret
  shares, each a tuple consisting of the participant identifier
  (a NonZeroScalar) and the key share (a Scalar).
- coefficients, a vector of MIN_PARTICIPANTS coefficients which
  uniquely determine a polynomial f.

def secret_share_shard(s, coefficients, MAX_PARTICIPANTS):
  # Prepend the secret to the coefficients
  coefficients = [s] + coefficients

  # Evaluate the polynomial for each point x=1,...,n
  secret_key_shares = []
  for x_i in range(1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS + 1):
    y_i = polynomial_evaluate(Scalar(x_i), coefficients)
    secret_key_share_i = (x_i, y_i)
    secret_key_shares.append(secret_key_share_i)
  return secret_key_shares, coefficients
~~~

Let `points` be the output of this function. The i-th element in `points` is
the share for the i-th participant, which is the randomly generated polynomial
evaluated at coordinate `i`. We denote a secret share as the tuple `(i, points[i])`,
and the list of these shares as `shares`. `i` MUST never equal `0`; recall that
`f(0) = s`, where `f` is the polynomial defined in a Shamir secret sharing operation.

The procedure for combining a `shares` list of length `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` to recover the
secret `s` is as follows; the algorithm `polynomial_interpolate_constant` is defined in {{dep-extended-polynomial-operations}}.

~~~
Inputs:
- shares, a list of at minimum MIN_PARTICIPANTS secret shares, each a
  tuple (i, f(i)) where i and f(i) are Scalars.

Outputs:
- s, the resulting secret that was previously split into shares,
  a Scalar.

Errors:
- "invalid parameters", if fewer than MIN_PARTICIPANTS input shares
  are provided.

def secret_share_combine(shares):
  if len(shares) < MIN_PARTICIPANTS:
    raise "invalid parameters"
  s = polynomial_interpolate_constant(shares)
  return s
~~~

### Additional polynomial operations  {#dep-extended-polynomial-operations}

This section describes two functions. One function, denoted `polynomial_evaluate`,
is for evaluating a polynomial `f(x)` at a particular point `x` using Horner's method,
i.e., computing `y = f(x)`. The other function, `polynomial_interpolate_constant`, is for
recovering the constant term of an interpolating polynomial defined by a set of points.

The function `polynomial_evaluate` is defined as follows.

~~~
Inputs:
- x, input at which to evaluate the polynomial, a Scalar
- coeffs, the polynomial coefficients, a list of Scalars

Outputs: Scalar result of the polynomial evaluated at input x

def polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):
  value = Scalar(0)
  for coeff in reverse(coeffs):
    value *= x
    value += coeff
  return value
~~~

The function `polynomial_interpolate_constant` is defined as follows.

~~~
Inputs:
- points, a set of t points with distinct x coordinates on
  a polynomial f, each a tuple of two Scalar values representing the
  x and y coordinates.

Outputs:
- f_zero, the constant term of f, i.e., f(0), a Scalar.

def polynomial_interpolate_constant(points):
  x_coords = []
  for (x, y) in points:
    x_coords.append(x)

  f_zero = Scalar(0)
  for (x, y) in points:
    delta = y * derive_interpolating_value(x_coords, x)
    f_zero += delta

  return f_zero
~~~

## Verifiable Secret Sharing {#dep-vss}

Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) {{?FeldmanSecretSharing=DOI.10.1109/SFCS.1987.4}}
builds upon Shamir secret sharing, adding a verification step to demonstrate the consistency of a participant's
share with a public commitment to the polynomial `f` for which the secret `s`
is the constant term. This check ensures that all participants have a point
(their share) on the same polynomial, ensuring that they can later reconstruct
the correct secret.

The procedure for committing to a polynomial `f` of degree at most `MIN_PARTICIPANTS-1` is as follows.

~~~
Inputs:
- coeffs, a vector of the MIN_PARTICIPANTS coefficients which
  uniquely determine a polynomial f.

Outputs:
- vss_commitment, a vector commitment to each of the coefficients in
  coeffs, where each item of the vector commitment is an Element.

def vss_commit(coeffs):
  vss_commitment = []
  for coeff in coeffs:
    A_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(coeff)
    vss_commitment.append(A_i)
  return vss_commitment
~~~

The procedure for verification of a participant's share is as follows.
If `vss_verify` fails, the participant MUST abort the protocol, and failure should be investigated out of band.

~~~
Inputs:
- share_i: A tuple of the form (i, sk_i), where i indicates the
  participant identifier (a NonZeroScalar), and sk_i the
  participant's secret key, a secret share of the constant term of f,
  where sk_i is a Scalar.
- vss_commitment, a VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector
  commitment to each of the coefficients in coeffs, where each
  element of the vector commitment is an Element.

Outputs:
- True if sk_i is valid, and False otherwise.

def vss_verify(share_i, vss_commitment)
  (i, sk_i) = share_i
  S_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk_i)
  S_i' = G.Identity()
  for j in range(0, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
    S_i' += G.ScalarMult(vss_commitment[j], pow(i, j))
  return S_i == S_i'
~~~

We now define how the Coordinator and participants can derive group info,
which is an input into the FROST signing protocol.

~~~
Inputs:
- MAX_PARTICIPANTS, the number of shares to generate, an integer.
- MIN_PARTICIPANTS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme,
  an integer.
- vss_commitment, a VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector
  commitment to each of the coefficients in coeffs, where each
  element of the vector commitment is an Element.

Outputs:
- PK, the public key representing the group, an Element.
- participant_public_keys, a list of MAX_PARTICIPANTS public keys
  PK_i for i=1,...,MAX_PARTICIPANTS, where each PK_i is the public
  key, an Element, for participant i.

def derive_group_info(MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS, vss_commitment)
  PK = vss_commitment[0]
  participant_public_keys = []
  for i in range(1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS+1):
    PK_i = G.Identity()
    for j in range(0, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
      PK_i += G.ScalarMult(vss_commitment[j], pow(i, j))
    participant_public_keys.append(PK_i)
  return PK, participant_public_keys
~~~

# Random Scalar Generation {#random-scalar}

Two popular algorithms for generating a random integer uniformly distributed in
the range \[0, G.Order() -1\] are as follows:

## Rejection Sampling

Generate a random byte array with `Ns` bytes, and attempt to map to a Scalar
by calling `DeserializeScalar` in constant time. If it succeeds, return the
result. If it fails, try again with another random byte array, until the
procedure succeeds. Failure to implement `DeserializeScalar` in constant time
can leak information about the underlying corresponding Scalar.

As an optimization, if the group order is very close to a power of
2, it is acceptable to omit the rejection test completely.  In
particular, if the group order is p, and there is an integer b
such that |p - 2<sup>b</sup>| is less than 2<sup>(b/2)</sup>, then
`RandomScalar` can simply return a uniformly random integer of at
most b bits.

## Wide Reduction

Generate a random byte array with `l = ceil(((3 * ceil(log2(G.Order()))) / 2) / 8)`
bytes, and interpret it as an integer; reduce the integer modulo `G.Order()` and return the
result. See {{Section 5 of HASH-TO-CURVE}} for the underlying derivation of `l`.


# Test Vectors

This section contains test vectors for all ciphersuites listed in {{ciphersuites}}.
All `Element` and `Scalar` values are represented in serialized form and encoded in
hexadecimal strings. Signatures are represented as the concatenation of their
constituent parts. The input message to be signed is also encoded as a hexadecimal
string.

Each test vector consists of the following information.

- Configuration. This lists the fixed parameters for the particular instantiation
  of FROST, including MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS, and NUM_PARTICIPANTS.
- Group input parameters. This lists the group secret key and shared public key,
  generated by a trusted dealer as described in {{dep-dealer}}, as well as the
  input message to be signed. The randomly generated coefficients produced by the
  trusted dealer to share the group signing secret are also listed. Each coefficient
  is identified by its index, e.g., `share_polynomial_coefficients[1]` is the coefficient
  of the first term in the polynomial. Note that the 0-th coefficient is omitted as this
  is equal to the group secret key. All values are encoded as hexadecimal strings.
- Signer input parameters. This lists the signing key share for each of the
  NUM_PARTICIPANTS participants.
- Round one parameters and outputs. This lists the NUM_PARTICIPANTS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their NonZeroScalar identifier, and for each participant:
  the hiding and binding commitment values produced in {{frost-round-one}}; the randomness
  values used to derive the commitment nonces in `nonce_generate`; the resulting group
  binding factor input computed in part from the group commitment list encoded as
  described in {{dep-encoding}}; and group binding factor as computed in {{frost-round-two}}).
- Round two parameters and outputs. This lists the NUM_PARTICIPANTS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their NonZeroScalar identifier, along with their corresponding
  output signature share as produced in {{frost-round-two}}.
- Final output. This lists the aggregate signature as produced in {{frost-aggregation}}.
